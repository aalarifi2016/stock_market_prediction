judiciary committee recommended that alphabet inc s googl o google apple inc aapl o amazon com amzn o and facebook fb o with a combined market value of over 5 trillion should not both control and compete in related businesses the panel s report broadly recommended structural separations but stopped short of saying a specific company should be broken up the scathing 449 page report the result of the first such congressional review of the tech industry suggested expansive changes to antitrust law and described dozens of instances where the companies misused their power to put it simply companies that once were scrappy underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons the report said in anticipation of the report amazon warned in a blog post tuesday against fringe notions of antitrust and market interventions that would kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores raising prices and reducing consumer choice google said in a statement that it competes fairly in a fast moving and highly competitive industry we

appropriate but we vehemently disagree with the conclusions the company also defended its commission rates and said it would issue a more extensive response in the coming days after more than a year of investigation involving 1 3 million documents and more than 300 interviews the committee led by democratic congressman david cicilline found companies were running marketplaces where they also competed enabling them to write one set of rules for others while they play by another coming just weeks before the nov 3 presidential election the report became an opportunity for republicans and democrats to boost their credibility in the fight against market domination by big tech companies that said congress is unlikely to act on the findings this year since the report reflects the views of the democratic majority in the house it signals that if joe biden wins the white house the pressure on the companies could well continue also the report is likely to inform existing antitrust probes against the companies by the federal trade commission and state attorneys general separately the u s justice department is investigating large technology companies and is expected to bring a lawsuit against google soon but the report was split along party lines republicans on the committee released two short reports one authored by representative ken buck and supported by three fellow republicans which bashed the companies but said that he would not support any call to break them up the other was a letter authored by representative jim jordan who criticized democrats for not probing big tech companies for alleged conservative bias and failing to show that existing antitrust law was inadequate the panel recommended companies be prohibited from operating in closely aligned businesses while they did not name any one company this recommendation would suggest that google which runs the auctions for online ad space and participates in those auctions should potentially be required to separate clearly or not even operate the two businesses for a factbox click facebook s acquisition of instagram in 2012 is another example of this instagram at the time was small and insignificant but facebook ceo mark zuckerberg saw its potential and noted that it was building networks that are competitive with our own and could be very disruptive to us the report said an email received by the committee on sunday from an unnamed former instagram employee disputed facebook s contention that the two apps could not easily be pulled apart at this stage they can just roll back the changes they ve been making over the past year and you d have two different apps again the person wrote it s turning something on and off as part of the report the committee staff drew up a menu of potential changes in antitrust law the suggestions ranged from the aggressive such as potentially barring companies like amazon com from operating the markets in which they also compete to the less controversial like increasing the budgets of the agencies that enforce antitrust law the justice department s antitrust division and the federal trade commission the report also urged congress to allow antitrust enforcers more leeway in stopping companies from purchasing potential rivals something that is now difficult the antitrust panel will take up the majority report after the october

AAPL,2019-01-02,Apple cuts sales forecast as China sales weaken; iPhone pricing in focus,san francisco bengaluru shanghai reuters apple inc on wednesday took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast with chief executive tim cook blaming slowing iphone sales in china whose economy has been dragged down by uncertainty around u s china trade relations the news which comes as a spotlight grows on beijing s attempts to revive stalling growth sent apple shares tumbling in after hours trade hammered asian suppliers and triggered a broader selloff in global markets the revenue drop for the just ended quarter underscores how an economic slowdown in china has been sharper than many expected catching companies and leaders in beijing off balance and forcing some to readjust their plans in the market while we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china apple ceo tim cook said in a letter to investors apple finds itself in a tricky position in china a key market for sales and where it manufactures the bulk of the iconic products it sells worldwide after the high profile arrest in canada of the cfo of domestic rival huawei technologies co ltd hwt ul since the arrest last month at the request of the united states there have been sporadic reports of chinese consumers shying away from apple products even before then local rivals like huawei had been gaining market share over apple cook told cnbc that apple products have not been targeted by the chinese government though some consumers may have elected not to buy an iphone or other apple devices due to the firm being an american brand the much larger issue is the slowing of the chinese economy and then the trade tension that has further pressured it cook said some analysts however questioned the impact of apple s own actions such as its unyielding pursuit of high selling prices for its products apple sales in china have not been doing well for a few quarters now part of the reason is that their price points have gone too high past the 1 000 mark said kiranjeet kaur an analyst at market research firm idc that s almost three times as expensive as phones from other vendors that are filling the mass market china s smartphone market has dropped sharply this year with apple and south

launched in 2007 apple shares skidded 7 7 percent in after hours trade dragging the company s market value below 700 billion in the broader market the s p 500 futures fell 1 5 percent in the u s

the cupertino california based company said it would quit disclosing unit sales data for iphones and other hardware items leading many analysts to worry that a drop in iphone sales was coming and after several component makers in november forecast weaker than expected sales some market watchers called the peak for iphones in several key markets in november cook cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as brazil india and russia for lower than anticipated sales estimates for the company s fiscal first quarter but cook specifically said he would not put china in that category of countries with troubled growth that all came before the damage to the chinese economy from trade tensions with the united states and long simmering structural issues became evident apple is now the highest profile multinational corporation to warn that the economic slowdown in china could hurt its business automakers such as ford motor co hyundai motor co and nissan motor co ltd all previously said they planned to cut production in the country but apple has held firm on its premium pricing strategy in china despite the risk of a slower economy the question for investors will be the extent to which apple s aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company s longer term pricing power within its iphone franchise james cordwell an analyst at atlantic equities told reuters in the latest fiscal year ended sept 29 unit sales of the iphone were essentially flat from the prior year while iphone revenue expanded 18 percent to 166 7 billion that growth came entirely from higher prices hal eddins chief economist at apple shareholder capital investment counsel said cook s comments on the impact of the u s trade tensions with china might be a dig at u s president donald trump but mostly he may be using the trade turmoil as an excuse for some missteps they ve made over the last year but some investors were heartened by apple s plans on using its cash pile in his letter cook said apple has 130 billion in net cash and that it intends to continue its efforts to reduce that cash balance to net zero which the company has so far accomplished through dividend increases and share buybacks we would anticipate the company increasing share buybacks on the weakness to return capital to shareholders at discount prices said trip miller managing

stocks as shares of apple inc aapl o and goldman sachs group inc gs n came under pressure randy frederick vice president of trading and derivatives for charles schwab in austin texas at the end of the week on friday people were sort of taking risk off the table going into the weekend that s not an uncommon thing especially when we had a pretty sharp rally earlier in the week after the midterm elections and then we have what i call a partial holiday today so anytime you ve got a weekend plus an almost holiday weekend although markets are open today the banks aren t for people to take some risk off the table especially after a bullish move in the market is not uncommon but i kind of thought we would have a bit of a bounce this morning and we didn t get that at all i think the bigger thing was the tech sector certainly it was a couple of stocks that do business with apple talking about lower orders and concerns about that and apple itself is down a lot it s a big bellwether in many indexes and it s considered a bellwether for the whole tech industry and i think that just kind of sparked some panic across several tech sectors including semiconductors the thing about tech is that it s the biggest sector in the market it s 21 percent of the overall market which is huge but also these guys have been an outperformer for a good part of this year and in fact not just this year but for several years so they tend to be highly volatile when they lead to the upside they also tend to lead to the downside and so when there becomes some concern about that people get a little uncertain a little scared and they start selling them off chuck carlson chief executive officer at horizon investment services in hammond indiana looks like we ve gone through the bulk of the earnings season so now the market s attention is going to be focused on non earnings related things and today s trading may be a bit exacerbated by the holiday and volumes may be a bit lower but a couple of things are going on one you continue to see the adjustment in market leadership today that was really accelerated with money continuing to move out of the high growth tech area spurred by reports that apple s smartphone business may be slowing money is shifting from there into risk off assets utilities defensive stocks dividend payers that s an adjustment that had been occurring for some time but there seems to be an acceleration today couple that with concerns about the dollar s strength and what that might mean for corporate profits going forward the biggest issue is the market continuing to grapple with what appears to be a pendulum swing back toward value dividend paying stocks risk off assets versus where we were early in the year which was growth growth growth when you have significant shifts like that you have tons of money that s flopping around out there it can result in days like this where you have these kinds of adjustments going on certainly volume will impact the thinner market and that can accentuate moves that is a factor that may be exacerbating the decline today you probably have a lower participant market today tomorrow it will be interesting to see if people are willing to step in and buy the two day dip when the bond market opens along with the stocks maybe the stock market took all of the selling today if people are in a selling mood they re going to sell what they can sell today the only thing they could sell were stocks tomorrow is going to be pretty telling in terms of how significant this one day trading activity was peter jankovskis

AAPL,2019-10-09,"Apple pulls app used to track Hong Kong police, Cook defends move",san francisco hong kong reuters apple inc has removed an app that helped hong kong protesters track police movements saying it was used to target officers after a chinese state newspaper sharply criticized the u s tech giant for allowing the software chief executive tim cook defended the move in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland china telling apple workers that this decision best protects our users the move to bar the hkmap live app which crowdsources the locations of both police and protesters from its app store plunges apple into the increasingly fraught political tension between china and the protesters that has also ensnared other u s and hong kong businesses the company only just last week had approved the app after rejecting it earlier this month alphabet inc s google on thursday said it had dropped a game from its app store that allowed players to pretend they were hong kong protesters saying its policies forbid capitalizing on ongoing sensitive events however google said it had found no policy violation by hkmap live and confirmed that the tracking app was available on its app store the chinese communist party s official newspaper on tuesday called the tracking app poisonous and decried what it said was apple s complicity in helping the hong kong protesters apple said in a statement on wednesday it had begun an immediate investigation after many concerned customers in hong kong contacted it about the app and apple found it had endangered law enforcement and residents the app displays police locations and we have verified with the hong kong cybersecurity and technology crime bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police threaten public safety and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement it said apple did not comment beyond its statement the company also removed backuphk a separate app that served as a mirror of the hkmap live app pressure maya wang a senior china researcher with human rights watch said there could be legitimate concerns of misuse of apps but that the statement from apple was disingenuous because it did not make any reference to pressure from beijing in the people s daily commentary given the context of how apple has over the years removed apps and removed access to news particularly inside mainland china that the chinese government doesn t want i think that the removal of this particular app strikes me as another shameful incident in which a multinational company bends to chinese government pressure she said republican u s senator marsha blackburn said apple and american companies should not fold to a communist regime s demands to shut down democracy activists cook in a letter to company workers said it was a difficult decision national and international debates will outlive us all and while important they do not govern the facts he said the app was being used maliciously to target individual police officers and to victimize individuals and property and so was in violation of hong kong law he said on twitter an account believed to be owned by the hkmap live app s developer said it disagreed with apple s decision and that there was no evidence to support the hong kong police s claims that the app had been used in ambushes the majority of user review s in app store suggest hkmap improved public safety not the opposite it said the app consolidates content from public posts on social networks and moderators delete content that solicits criminal activity and would ban repeated attempts to post such content in the app it added neither china s foreign ministry nor the information office of the state council had an immediate comment when asked about the hkmap live app removal hong kong police also had no immediate comment separately apple removed the quartz news app from its app store in china because authorities said it violated local laws quartz chief executive zach seward told technology publication the verge in a statement we abhor this kind of government censorship of the internet and have great coverage of how to get around such bans around the world a google spokesman said the revolution of our times app recently pulled from its app store which lets users role play as hong kong protesters violated a long standing policy prohibiting developers from capitalizing on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game the people s daily newspaper in its commentary on tuesday said apple did not have a sense of right and wrong and ignored the truth making the app available on apple s hong kong app store at this time was opening the door to violent protesters in the former british colony the newspaper wrote the hkmap live app was taken down from apple s app store globally on wednesday but continued to work for users who had previously downloaded it in hong kong reuters found a web version of hkmap live was still viewable on iphones word of its removal spread quickly in hong kong where residents had been campaigning for months in sometimes violent demonstrations initially to protest a now withdrawn extradition bill and now in a broader push for democratic rights does the entire world have to suck up

kong said apple seemed to have a case given the circumstances it sounds like they are being responsible to do nothing when it s being used for a specific purpose that actually facilitates these protests to do nothing would be rather irresponsible he said apple s action has come amid a furor surrounding the u s national basketball association after a team official tweeted in support of the

AAPL,2020-01-21,Exclusive: Apple dropped plan for encrypting backups after FBI complained - sources,san francisco reuters apple inc aapl o dropped plans to let iphone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company s icloud service after the fbi complained that the move would harm investigations six sources familiar with the matter told reuters the tech giant s reversal about two years ago has not previously been reported it shows how much apple has been willing to help u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies despite taking a harder line in high profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers information the long running tug of war between investigators concerns about security and tech companies desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week as u s attorney general william barr took the rare step of publicly calling on apple to unlock two iphones used by a saudi air force officer who shot dead three americans at a pensacola florida naval base last month u s president donald trump piled on accusing apple on twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by killers drug dealers and other violent criminal elements republican and democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a december hearing threatening legislation against end to end encryption citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children apple did in fact did turn over the shooter s icloud backups in the pensacola case and said it rejected the characterization that it has not provided substantive assistance behind the scenes apple has provided the u s federal bureau of investigation with more sweeping help not related to any specific probe an apple spokesman declined to comment on the company s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the fbi the fbi did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with apple more than two years ago apple told the fbi that it planned to offer users end to end encryption when storing their phone data on icloud according to one current and three former fbi officials and one current and one former apple employee under that plan primarily designed to thwart hackers apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order in private talks with apple soon after representatives of the fbi s cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iphone using suspects the government sources said when apple spoke privately to the fbi about its work on phone security the following year the end to end encryption plan had been dropped according to the six sources reuters could not determine why exactly apple dropped the plan legal killed it for reasons you can imagine another former apple employee said he was told without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the fbi was a factor in the decision that person told reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption they decided they weren t going to poke the bear anymore the person said referring to apple s court battle with the fbi in 2016 over access to an iphone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in san bernardino california apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the fbi the government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone a common occurrence in fbi investigations two of the former fbi officials who were not present in talks with apple told reuters it appeared that the fbi s arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed it s because apple was convinced said one outside of that public spat over san bernardino apple gets along with the federal government however a former apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often once the decision was made the 10 or so experts on the apple encryption project variously code named plesio and keydrop were told to stop working on the effort three people familiar with the matter told reuters apple s decision not to proceed with end to end encryption of icloud backups made the fbi s job easier the agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone but that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user who is often the subject of the investigation apple s icloud on the other hand can be searched in secret in the first half of last year the period covered by apple s most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies u s authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other icloud content in 1 568 cases covering about 6 000 accounts the company said it turned over at least some data for 90 of the requests it received it turns over data more often in response to secret u s intelligence court directives which sought content from more than 18 000 accounts in the first half of 2019 the most recently reported six month period had it proceeded with its plan apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end to end encryption instead of protecting all of icloud with end to end encryption apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information such as saved passwords and health data but backed up contact information and texts from imessage whatsapp and other encrypted services remain available to apple employees and authorities apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers information in october 2018 alphabet inc s googl o google announced a similar system to apple s dropped plan for secure backups the maker of android software which runs on about three quarters of the world s mobile devices said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key two people familiar with the project said google gave no advance notice to governments and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news the company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option the fbi did not respond to a request for comment on google s service or the agency s

AAPL,2018-08-01,Scolding from Chinese state media dampens Apple's earnings cheer,beijing reuters apple inc aapl o may have just notched up its fourth straight quarter of double digit revenue growth in china but among some chinese consumers the glow was overshadowed by chinese state media s tirade of criticism against the smartphone giant on tuesday evening in china hours before apple s earnings china s official state broadcaster railed against the firm in a 30 minute special report accusing it of allowing illegal content including gambling apps onto its platform the program was one of at least five reports by state media that targeted the company in the past week although beijing has criticized apple before the attacks highlight an increasingly fraught balancing act for the firm in the world s biggest smartphone market where trade friction tighter regulations and fierce competition threaten robust consumer appetite for its iphones and other products mo jia an analyst at industry tracker canalys said the reports needed to be seen as part of the u s china trade conflict noting tensions over a u s ban imposed on telecommunications equipment maker zte corp 0763 hk000063 sz that has yet to be lifted the chinese government is maybe trying to warn the u s government in a similar way by saying your tech firm in china is not that safe either he said the trump administration has upped the ante in its trade war with beijing considering a 25 percent tariff on 200 billion worth of chinese goods that prompted china on wednesday to say blackmail wouldn t work and to threaten to hit back the criticism of apple also comes ahead of a new campaign by the country s regulators to clean up spam and unsolicited calls which are a pervasive issue in china where phone numbers are often sold on black markets the 18 month campaign was announced on monday and starts in july apple has been specifically mentioned in some reports about such problems major communication operators in china have little ability to prevent such spam messages since apple says it has no right to monitor user messages out of privacy concerns the people s daily said last week apple declined to comment on the state media reports while a fax to the chinese internet regulator requesting comment did not receive a response like its performance in other regions much of the 19 percent revenue growth in china for the last quarter was led by the price hike for the iphone x it retails for 9 605 yuan 1 415 in china a price tag that doesn t appear to be fazing the chinese smartphone consumer apple s efforts to alter the iphone x s appearance and new features such as facial recognition have gone down well a contrast to the iphone 7 which had a less substantive upgrade and led to a sharp china sales decline in 2016 for the firm i had to buy the x not even the 8 because it has a better camera a larger screen and also for the face recognition said an 18 year old college student who gave her first name as feifei but the question of brand loyalty always looms large in china particularly at a time when state media has stepped up its criticism chances are i may have to shift to a domestic smartphone to support chinese companies said michelle huang a 23 year old bank worker in beijing who owns an iphone and is thinking of getting a new phone competition in china has also gotten tougher huawei technologies hwt ul overtook apple to become the world s second biggest smartphone seller in the june quarter data from market research firms showed as it expanded its lead back home canalys jia said however that he did not see too much of an immediate threat to apple from the state media reports apple s fan base is quite stable in china and they are premium users so they not so easily swayed by the government and the news he said in a quick reuters survey of 24 smartphone users on the streets of beijing on wednesday 17 had heard of the state media reports eleven said apple s efforts to protect consumers were sufficient while six said they believed the company should increase its efforts to vet content under pressure from china apple has bowed before last year it removed over a thousand apps from its app store on request from regulators who called on all app store providers to purge unsanctioned news messaging and other apps that would allow users to access foreign websites it also began migrating chinese icloud accounts to local servers under new laws that require it to hand over the reins to a partner firm that is overseen by a government work group the resulting apple experience for chinese iphone users has become highly localized in the past year with less crossover between apps and features in foreign markets the concessions have allowed apple to keep its core services unlike facebook inc fb o and alphabet inc s google googl o which have been relegated to the edges of china s consumer market following battles with regulators this story has been refiled to

AAPL,2018-11-14,A matter of volume: threat from ascendant Chinese phones hangs over Apple,san francisco reuters a raft of profit warnings from apple inc aapl o suppliers this week has fueled investor concerns that iphone sales in terms of volume have hit a wall that could spell trouble for the company s plans to make services its main pillar of growth for the past year investors had largely been willing to overlook stagnating unit sales of the iphone because average selling prices kept rising but it now faces fierce competition from mid priced phones from makers such as xiaomi corp 1810 hk apple has often stated its plan to increase its revenue from paid services such as apple music and icloud that at least in part requires a growing base of device owners driven by its iphone which analysts believe accounts for about two thirds of the 1 3 billion apple devices in use around the world wall street analysts have expressed concerns that slower overall smartphone sales will make it harder for apple to hold smartphone market share as people put off buying its generally more expensive phones that in turn could hurt the growth of apple s services revenue said bernstein s toni sacconaghi without volume growth in promising overseas markets such as india brazil and russia the worry among analysts and investors is that apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it more than 1 000 for its top models hal eddins chief economist for apple shareholder capital investment counsel said phones like the oneplus 6t are roughly comparable to apple s high end phones for almost half the price you can get a lot of phone for a lot less he said the phone landscape is rapidly changing and i think manufacturers are missing a trick by going the 1 000 route apple declined to comment on its strategy or the share moves among its suppliers the company s executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from its large supply chain apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone an argument that sales data suggests apple made successfully the company also has customer satisfaction and loyalty rates that are unparalleled in the mobile phone industry said ben bajarin an analyst with creative strategies nevertheless a trio of chinese smartphone makers xiaomi oppo and vivo accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018 according to data from research firm idc up from just 8 9 percent for all of 2014 and almost 20 percent last year with the exception of fiscal 2015 apple has not increased its market share it had 13 6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year down from 14 8 percent for 2014 although its share typically rises with full year results due to strong sales in december the 1 3 billion iphones ipads and macs used around the world serves as the pool of potential customers for apple s services a business that hit 37 1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year that represented 14 percent of apple s overall revenue up from 8 5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iphone unit sales hit their all time high but idc expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2 4 percent on a compound basis to 1 6 billion units by 2022 indicating a saturated market in which the cupertino california based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer xiaomi in particular is gaining fans rapidly in india where apple has only a minor presence xiaomi has in some quarters beat samsung electronics co ltd 005930 ks to become the country s top phone seller and is also making headway into european markets like spain idc said in a report according to data from idc xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in india in the first and second quarters of 2018 with 30 3 percent and 29 7 percent respectively of the market for smartphone units there this is the case where it s much different in other parts of the world said ryan reith program vice president for idc s mobile device tracking program noting that most u s consumers are not familiar with xiaomi oppo and vivo phones many of those brands don t play in the united states but they re playing in places where they never played before such as india and europe he said in its latest earnings this month apple shocked investors with a lower than expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping quarter and with its announcement that it would stop reporting unit sales for its hardware products as has been customary for the last 20 years underscoring flattening iphone unit sales it also said it sold 217 7 million iphones in its most recent fiscal year virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231 2 million in fiscal 2015 its share price hit at the time of the forecast has since extended losses after profit warnings from suppliers like japan display inc 6740 t british chipmaker iqe plc iqe l and lumentum holdings inc lite o the stock is now down about 8 percent since its nov 1 earnings apple s newest models such as the iphone xs and iphone xr are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies but they range up to 1 449 in price out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets apple s strategy is to lure those consumers to its eco system with older models at cheaper prices it has also emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices but chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher end chips and features like under the glass fingerprint sensors that seek to attract consumers who might otherwise give apple s phones a look those manufacturers are increasingly adopting qualcomm inc s qcom o most powerful mobile phone chips said cristiano amon the head of chip operations at the u s chipmaker which is locked in a bitter court dispute with apple those phones were initially sold in china but we ve also seen them gaining share outside china especially in areas such as india and europe amon said on its home turf too apple is facing new challenges from at least one chinese maker oneplus which is creeping in to the u s firm s traditionally high pricing territory though the iphone 7 s processor chip beats the oneplus 6t in some speed tests posted by chip tracking firm geekbench the oneplus phone has a contemporary design with thin bezels around the display similar to newer iphone models after years of being available in the united states only via an online store and developing a following among tech enthusiasts the oneplus 6t is being carried by t mobile us inc tmus o stores at 549 it sits between the iphone 7 and iphone 8 in terms of pricing kyle kiang the general manager for north america for oneplus said first day sales of the new model were 86 percent higher in the united states than for the previous oneplus released there although he did not disclose absolute unit figures he said sales were higher

AAPL,2019-03-24,FOCUS-Apple's iPhone struggles unravel ambitions of Japan Display, repeats story from march 22 no changes to text tokyo march 22 reuters when japan display inc broke ground on a new factory in central japan in 2015 the future looked bright for one of the world s top vendors of liquid crystal display lcd panels the plant would strengthen the company s position as the primary screen supplier for apple inc as sales of the iphone 6 soared and the u s smartphone juggernaut said it would front most of the 1 5 billion in costs with japan display paying it back with a percentage of screen sales according to two company sources four years later apple s shifting fortunes have brought japan display to its knees and threaten to end japan s long run as a leader in display technology a slowdown in iphone sales combined with a proliferation of new iphone models many of which use newer organic light emitting displays oled have left japan display s new factory running at half capacity but it still owes apple a majority of the construction cost one of the company sources said he declined to give the exact amount desperate for capital japan display is looking to an investor group led by china silkroad investment capital for a bailout two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the deal would give the chinese group a near majority stake in exchange for an investment of 500 million to 700 million the sources said the group plans to build an oled panel plant in china using japan display s technology according to those two sources the company s woes show how weak iphone sales and a broader slowdown in the smartphone business are causing pain across the asian electronics supply chain in retrospect the new plant was unnecessary one of the sources with direct knowledge of the bailout talks said but the decision wasn t wrong back then japan display started to pick up steam thanks to apple at the time and apple wanted the new plant japan display wasn t alone in betting on robust growth in iphone sales which looked especially attractive because of apple s now abandoned strategy of offering few variations in each product cycle we were all thrilled to see lifetime sales of a single iphone model reaching 100 million units a source at another apple parts supplier said supplying components for just one model in massive volume is extremely cost efficient he said at the same time we exposed ourselves to huge volatility risks japan display has built relationships with other smartphone vendors including chinese powerhouses huawei xiaomi and oppo but it is losing their orders too as sales growth softens and the chinese players switch to domestic panel makers such as boe technology and tianma microelectronics which have sharply improved the quality of their screens japan display supplied almost a third of huawei s smartphone screens in 2015 but its share had plunged to 4 percent by the third quarter last year as the chinese company turned to boe and tianma according to researcher ihs markit sources at japan display and other apple suppliers interviewed for the story declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media suppliers rarely speak about business with apple on the record because of strict non disclosure agreements japan display was formed in 2012 in a government backed merger of the ailing display units of sony corp toshiba corp and hitachi ltd it boasts strength in so called thin film transistor technology tft crucial for making high resolution images on both lcd and oled panels in addition to its apple business which accounted for more than half the company s revenue over the last four years it s a top supplier of dashboard panels for major automotive component companies such as continental but japan display has struggled to navigate the fast changing display business its new lcd factory was still under construction when apple informed japan display in autumn 2015 that it planned to move quickly away from lcd to the newer oled technology two former company officials said it was too costly by then to abandon the half completed plant one of them said japan display s management at the time led by former sanyo electric executive mitsuru homma promised to start mass production of oled panels by 2018 in the meantime the management shut down older unprofitable lcd lines to shift resources to oled but its main investor a state backed fund blocked plans for drastic job cuts for fear of public backlash one of the former officials said unexpectedly weak sales of the iphone 6s created a cash crunch in 2016 and homma resigned early the next year after the company took a 640 million bailout from the state backed fund the new chief executive nobuhiro higashiiriki declared a full on shift to oled but the company was already behind rivals notably samsung electronics and still needed more cash for oled investment disappointing sales of the iphone xr the only lcd model in apple s 2018 lineup were yet another blow the company now looks exhausted with many engineers leaving one former employee said some board members have expressed concerns about technology transfer that may follow the proposed chinese investment sources familiar with the talks said but the government investment fund has run out of patience we don t have any other option one of the company sources said adding that the government has been quiet about the bailout plan they could argue that display technologies are not something japan must keep and protect

digital certificates to get access to a program apple introduced to let corporations distribute business apps to their employees without going through apple s tightly controlled app store using so called enterprise developer certificates these pirate operations are providing modified versions of popular apps to consumers enabling them to stream music without ads and to circumvent fees and rules in games depriving apple and legitimate app makers of revenue by doing so the pirate app distributors are violating the rules of apple s developer programs which only allow apps to be distributed to the general public through the app store downloading modified versions violates the terms of service of almost all major apps tutuapp panda helper appvalley and tweakbox did not respond to multiple requests for comment apple has no way of tracking the real time distribution of these certificates or the spread of improperly modified apps on its phones but it can cancel the certificates if it finds misuse developers that abuse our enterprise certificates are in violation of the apple developer enterprise program agreement and will have their certificates terminated and if appropriate they will be removed from our developer program completely an apple spokesperson told reuters we are continuously evaluating the cases of misuse and are prepared to take immediate action after reuters initially contacted apple for comment last week some of the pirates were banned from the system but within days they were using different certificates and were operational again there s nothing stopping these companies from doing this again from another team another developer account said amine hambaba head of security at software firm shape security apple confirmed a media report on wednesday that it would require two factor authentication using a code sent to a phone as well as a password to log into all developer accounts by the end of this month which could help prevent certificate misuse major app makers spotify technology sa rovio entertainment oyj and niantic inc have begun to fight back spotify declined to comment on the matter of modified apps but the streaming music provider did say earlier this month that its new terms of service would crack down on users who are creating or distributing tools designed to block advertisements on its service rovio the maker of angry birds mobile games said it actively works with partners to address infringement for the benefit of both our player community and rovio as a business niantic which makes pokemon go said players who use pirated apps that enable cheating on its game are regularly banned for violating its terms of service microsoft corp which owns the creative building game minecraft declined to comment it is unclear how much revenue the pirate distributors are siphoning away from apple and legitimate app makers tutuapp offers a free version of minecraft which costs 6 99 in apple s app store appvalley offers a version of spotify s free streaming music service with the advertisements stripped away the distributors make money by charging 13 or more per year for subscriptions to what they calls vip versions of their services which they say are more stable than the free versions it is impossible to know how many users buy such subscriptions but the pirate distributors combined have more than 600 000 followers on twitter security researchers have long warned about the misuse of enterprise developer certificates which act as digital keys that tell an iphone a piece of software downloaded from the internet can be trusted and opened they are the centerpiece of apple s program for corporate apps and enable consumers to install apps onto iphones without apple s knowledge apple last month briefly banned facebook inc and alphabet inc from using enterprise certificates after they used them to distribute data gathering apps to consumers the distributors of pirated apps seen by reuters are using certificates obtained in the name of legitimate businesses although it is unclear how several pirates have impersonated a subsidiary of china mobile ltd china mobile did not respond to requests for comment tech news website techcrunch earlier this week reported that certificate abuse also enabled the distribution of apps for pornography and gambling both of which are banned from the app store since the app store debuted in 2008 apple has sought to portray the iphone as safer than rival android devices because apple reviews and approves all apps distributed to the devices early on hackers jailbroke iphones by modifying their software to evade apple s controls but that process voided the iphone s warranty and scared off many casual users the misuse of the enterprise certificates seen by reuters does not rely on jailbreaking and can be used on unmodified iphones this version of the story was refiled to replace that with about the in paragraph 19

AAPL,2018-11-07,How Apple is losing its grip on India,bengaluru reuters software engineer samee alam was ready to take the big leap and buy an iphone in this week s diwali festival sales but at the last minute he opted for cheaper chinese competitor oneplus instead alam 27 spends hours on his phone watching shows surfing and shopping making him the perfect target for apple inc as it strives to raise sales among india s 1 3 billion consumers but in a country where the average per capita income is around 2 000 a year even the cheapest of this year s new iphones the xr at 76 900 rupees 1 058 costs twice as much as many of the alternatives hong kong based counterpoint research says that iphone sales are falling as a result from three million phones in 2017 sales may sink to two million this year according to their estimate the first decline in four years more than half of those sales will come from cheaper older models and the lack of progress in india was among problems cited by chief executive officer tim cook when he gave a disappointing holiday outlook last week even in the premium segment smartphones that cost more than 400 apple lagged samsung and china s oneplus in the third quarter i have never used an iphone and i was keen on getting my hands on one but it didn t make sense says alam who works for one of the raft of firms to have invested in the southern city of bengaluru often called india s silicon valley i look for storage camera and processor in phones and cheaper alternatives like oneplus are more value for the money the new iphones cost almost 100 000 rupees i can get three good phones for that price or even a decent gaming laptop solid mac sales and the high unit price of iphones meant apple s total revenue of 2 billion in india last year was still double that of oneplus which only sells mobile phones but counterpoint s data says that gap will also shrink oneplus india head vikas agarwal told reuters this week that 10 15 percent of new customers in recent months have been defectors from apple suggesting even some loyalists are opting out of upgrading their handsets apple s problems go beyond price the company facing down a handful of regulatory headaches lost some of its top executives in india at the start of this year an apple spokesman said the departures had nothing to do with the company s performance but people familiar with the matter told reuters that the departures were likely linked to the company changing its distribution system apple has cut the number of distributors in the country to two from five the sources who declined to be identified because they have business relationships with apple also said company veteran michel columb is still working on solidifying business relations since taking control of the indian operation in december apple declined to comment further prime minister narendra modi s government has sought to drive electronics producers into manufacturing locally by steadily moving tariffs up the supply chain from simple phone cases to sophisticated chipsets and boards along with local firms like lava global smartphone giants including samsung electronics co ltd oppo and xiaomi corp have responded aggressively investing millions of dollars in plants around bengaluru and delhi tech hub noida apple is the only major player which does not manufacture phones in the country and it only assembles two low cost older models through wistron corp in bengaluru industry experts say as a result the company still imports about 70 80 percent of its phones that results in high import duties which in turn make the phones expensive in the united states the basic iphone xr model costs 749 or roughly 54 400 rupees only two thirds of its retail price in india beyond that while u s phones are subsidized under deals with wireless carriers apple s phones in india are not apple doesn t have enough confidence in the indian manufacturing system right now to set up plants and move some of the manufacturing out of china said analyst navkendar singh of tech consulting firm idc in the process they are losing around 15 20 percent of their tax incentive which they could have passed on to the consumer diwali the festival of lights is peak selling time for electronics in india but the apple licensed store in one of bengaluru s big shopping malls was deserted this past saturday features of the emerging phones are very similar to an iphone says salesman aejaz ahmed adding volumes have fallen in the past few months it is very difficult to make out the difference from a distance because they even look so alike sales staff at several stores in bengaluru and nearby chennai pointed to the launch this year of the latest oneplus phone as a major problem for the u s phonemaker at 37 999 rupees the chinese company s 6t is half the price of the xr the result says neil shah from counterpoint is that apple s user base in india is set to decline about 10 percent to nine million users this year that compares to an estimated 436 million android users if your user base is declining you are losing grip on the market he says the new customer base is not coming

AAPL,2020-12-21,Exclusive: Apple targets car production by 2024 and eyes 'next level' battery technology - sources, reuters apple inc is moving forward with self driving car technology and is targeting 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle that could include its own breakthrough battery technology people familiar with the matter told reuters the iphone maker s automotive efforts known as project titan have proceeded unevenly since 2014 when it first started to design its own vehicle from scratch at one point apple drew back the effort to focus on software and reassessed its goals doug field an apple veteran who had worked at tesla inc returned to oversee the project in 2018 and laid off 190 people from the team in 2019 since then apple has progressed enough that it now aims to build a vehicle for consumers two people familiar with the effort said asking not to be named because apple s plans are not public apple s goal of building a personal vehicle for the mass market contrasts with rivals such as alphabet inc s waymo which has built robo taxis to carry passengers for a driverless ride hailing service central to apple s strategy is a new battery design that could radically reduce the cost of batteries and increase the vehicle s range according to a third person who has seen apple s battery design apple declined to comment on its plans or future products making a vehicle represents a supply chain challenge even for apple a company with deep pockets that makes hundreds of millions of electronics products each year with parts from around the world but has never made a car it took elon musk s tesla 17 years before it finally turned a sustained profit making cars if there is one company on the planet that has the resources to do that it s probably apple but at the same time it s not a cellphone said a person who worked on project titan it remains unclear who would assemble an apple branded car but sources have said they expect the company to rely on a manufacturing partner to build vehicles and there is still a chance apple will decide to reduce the scope of its efforts to an autonomous driving system that would be integrated with a car made by a traditional automaker rather than the iphone maker selling an apple branded car one of the people added two people with knowledge of apple s plans warned pandemic related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond shares of tesla ended 6 5 lower on monday after their debut in the s p 500 on monday apple shares ended 1 24 higher after the news apple has decided to tap outside partners for elements of the system including lidar sensors which help self driving cars get a three dimensional view of the road two people familiar with the company s plans said apple s car might feature multiple lidar sensors for scanning different distances another person said some sensors could be derived from apple s internally developed lidar units that person said apple s iphone 12 pro and ipad pro models released this year both feature lidar sensors reuters had previously reported that apple had held talks with potential lidar suppliers but it was also examining building its own sensor as for the car s battery apple plans to use a unique monocell design that bulks up the individual cells in the battery and frees up space inside the battery pack by eliminating pouches and modules that hold battery materials one of the people said apple s design means that more active material can be packed inside the battery giving the car a potentially longer range apple is also examining a chemistry for the battery called lfp or lithium iron phosphate the person said which is inherently less likely to overheat and is thus safer than other types of lithium ion batteries it s next level the person said of apple s battery technology like the first time you saw the iphone apple had previously engaged magna international inc in talks about manufacturing a car but the talks petered out as apple s plans became unclear a person familiar with those previous efforts said magna did not immediately respond to a request for comment to turn a profit automotive contract manufacturers often ask for volumes that could pose a challenge even to apple which would be a newcomer to the automotive market in order to have a viable assembly plant you need 100 000 vehicles annually with more volume to come the person said some apple investors reacted to the reuters report on the company s plans with caution trip miller managing partner at apple investor gullane capital partners said it could be tough for apple to produce large volumes of cars out of the gate it would seem to me that if apple develops some advanced operating system or battery technology it would be best utilized in a partnership with an existing manufacturer under license miller said as we see with tesla and the legacy auto companies having a very complex manufacturing network around the globe doesn t happen overnight hal eddins chief economist at apple shareholder capital investment counsel said apple has a history of higher margins than most automakers my initial reaction as a shareholder is huh eddins said still don t really see the appeal of the car business but apple may be eyeing another angle than what i m seeing ,0.1222138265774629,0.4311172766627311,128.04

AAPL,2018-12-20,Apple to pull some iPhones in Germany as Qualcomm extends global wins,munich san francisco reuters chip supplier qualcomm inc won a second court skirmish in its worldwide patent battle with apple inc on thursday with the iphone maker saying it would pull some older models from its german stores qualcomm s win in germany comes weeks after it secured a court order to ban sales of some iphone models in china apple which is contesting both rulings has continued to offer its iphones in china but made changes to its ios operating system in the wake of the chinese order the german victory may affect only a few million iphones out of the hundreds of millions that apple sells each year still it is a small but clear win in a complex legal battle that will spin into overdrive in the coming months as antitrust regulators and apple both take qualcomm to court in the united states apple alleges that qualcomm engaged in illegal behavior to preserve a monopoly on modem chips which help mobile devices connect to wireless data networks qualcomm has in turn accused apple of using the chip supplier s vast stable of technology innovations without proper compensation while a sales ban in china could hurt apple s bottom line it is unlikely the two patent skirmishes will sway the outcome of the broader battle where qualcomm has suffered a series of setbacks fighting u s antitrust regulators shares of apple were down 2 3 percent at 157 12 in late trading weighing on the broader market qualcomm shares were down 0 2 percent at 56 69 qualcomm is not pursuing the software patents in the chinese case in other jurisdictions and suffered an early loss while pursuing a u s sales ban on the u s version of the hardware patent at issue in germany on thursday apple said it would pull older iphones from its german stores after a court ruled that apple had infringed a hardware patent of qualcomm inc and banned sales of iphones there with chips from apple supplier qorvo inc two respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of qualcomm s patents and declared apple an infringer ordering a ban on iphones in the important markets of germany and china don rosenberg qualcomm s general counsel said in a statement for each of the two apple entities it won orders against qualcomm needs to post a bond of about 668 4 million euros or 765 9 million before it can begin proceedings to enforce the order a move qualcomm said it would carry out within a few days the smartphone maker said it was appealing the decision but the order goes into effect as soon as qualcomm posts the bond apple said it would pull some phones from its stores while it pursued an appeal we are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal apple said in a statement all iphone models remain available to customers through carriers and resellers in 4 300 locations across germany during the appeal process iphone 7 and iphone 8 models will not be available at apple s 15 retail stores in germany iphone xs iphone xs max and iphone xr will remain available in all our stores stacy rasgon an analyst with research firm bernstein said in a note that germnany was a small iphone market for apple selling about 10 million units a year with possibly only half of those being the older models affected by the court s order when qualcomm posts the bond to enforce the order it could seek to extend the ban to apple s resellers and the newer iphone models not included thus far legal experts said qualcomm said the court had granted its request for a recall and destruction of all accused devices from all retailers in germany but pressing forward with enforcement presents some risks for qualcomm in an earlier proceeding before the u s international trade commission u s regulators viewed a more extensive set of technical evidence about whether qorvo s chips and apple s phones violated qualcomm s patents those u s regulators sided with apple and qorvo if higher courts in germany do the same when apple appeals qualcomm could be forced to forfeit its bond if the decision becomes final the german case is qualcomm s third major effort to secure a ban on apple s lucrative iphones over patent infringement allegations after similar efforts in the u s and china in the united states qualcomm sought to ban the import of iphones with chips from intel corp trade regulators found apple had infringed one qualcomm patent but so far declined to ban the phones with intel chips because regulators feared it would hurt competition in the chip marketplace competition authorities around the world have repeatedly found qualcomm s licensing practices unlawful yet qualcomm continues to try to achieve the same results through a campaign of patent lawsuits steven rodgers intel s general counsel said in a statement after the ruling in germany in germany the judge ruled that phones with a chip from apple supplier qorvo violate one of qualcomm s patents around so called envelope tracking a feature that helps mobile phones save battery power while sending and receiving wireless signals mike baker qorvo s chief intellectual property counsel said in a statement that u s trade regulators had ruled that qorvo s chips did not violate the u s version of qualcomm s patent and that the chip s inventor wasn t allowed to testify at the german hearing we believe our envelope tracking chip does not infringe the patent in suit and the court would have come to a different conclusion if it had considered all the evidence baker said in china apple is still pursuing a so called request for reconsideration with the court that issued the bans apple said its phones remained on sale and it believed it has complied with the chinese court s order but it also made changes to its iphone software in the wake of the ruling qualcomm believes apple is violating the chinese court order despite the new software and must stop selling phones

AAPL,2019-05-13,"In setback for Apple, U.S. Supreme Court lets App Store antitrust suit proceed",washington reuters a divided u s supreme court on monday gave the go ahead to an antitrust lawsuit accusing apple inc of forcing consumers to overpay for iphone software applications a decision that could lead to billions of dollars in damages and put at risk the company s lucrative way of selling apps in a 5 4 ruling the justices upheld a lower court s decision to allow the proposed class action lawsuit to proceed the consumer plaintiffs claim apple monopolized the market in violation of federal antitrust law by requiring that apps be sold through its app store and extracting an excessive 30 percent commission on purchases apple s shares fell 5 8 to 185 72 the ruling came on a day when apple shares already were trading lower because of concerns over a full blown u s china trade war the cupertino california based technology company backed by u s president donald trump s administration in the case argued that it was only acting as an agent for app developers who set their own prices and pay apple s commission monday s ruling written by justice brett kavanaugh did not resolve the merits of the claim against apple but if the plaintiffs win at trial mark rifkin a lawyer representing them said that the overcharges paid by consumers since apple s monopoly began will be measured in the billions of dollars in a statement apple said we re confident we will prevail when the facts are presented and that the app store is not a monopoly by any metric the dispute hinged in part on how the justices would apply a 1977 supreme court precedent in that case the court limited damages for anti competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others kavanaugh explained from the bench that the 1977 precedent was not a get out of court free card for monopolistic retailers an apparent allusion to the popular board game monopoly apple s theory would provide a roadmap for monopolistic retailers to structure transactions with manufacturers or suppliers so as to evade antitrust claims by consumers and thereby thwart effective antitrust enforcement kavanaugh wrote in the ruling apple has said the consumers were indirect purchasers at best because any overcharge would be passed on to them by developers the iphone users who sued countered that they pay apple not an app developer whenever buying an app from the app store and were therefore direct victims of the overcharges siding with the consumers kavanaugh a conservative appointed by trump joined the court s four liberal justices to rule against apple dissenting from the decision conservative justice neil gorsuch said the decision is not how antitrust law is supposed to work because it gives a green light to the exact type of case that the court had previously prohibited gorsuch also was appointed by trump apple had avoided much of the antitrust scrutiny faced by other technology firms including facebook largely by arguing that it does not have a dominant position in the many markets in which it operates from smart phones and laptops to streaming music services the lawsuit along with complaints over app store policies to european officials from rivals such as streaming music spotify could draw apple into the broader public debate over the market power of large tech companies the legal setback for apple comes as investors are looking to the company s services business including its app store to fuel growth as iphone sales slow rifkin said he was gratified by the court s decision which reaffirmed the straightforward principle that consumers who purchase a monopolized product directly from the alleged monopolist may sue the monopolist to recover the full amount of the overcharge they are forced to pay by reason of the monopoly apple said in its statement developers set the price they want to charge for their app and apple has no role in that the vast majority of apps on the app store are free and apple gets nothing from them the ruling could lead to other lawsuits against tech companies that act as platforms for other products or services apple had warned that this could pose a threat to e commerce a rapidly expanding segment of the u s economy worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual sales the plaintiffs including lead plaintiff robert pepper of chicago filed the suit in a california federal court in 2011 claiming apple s monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources they were supported by 30 state attorneys general including from texas california and new york apple also backed by the u s chamber of commerce business group had sought to dismiss the case arguing the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to sue after a federal judge in oakland threw out the suit the san francisco based 9th u s circuit court of appeals revived it in 2017 finding that apple was a distributor that sold iphone apps directly to consumers ,0.1565859487734487,0.4403972763347763,45.65

AAPL,2018-11-26,U.S. top court leans towards allowing Apple App Store antitrust suit,washington reuters u s supreme court justices on monday appeared open to letting a lawsuit proceed against apple inc aapl o that accused it of breaking federal antitrust laws by monopolizing the market for iphone software applications and causing consumers to overpay the nine justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by the cupertino california based technology company of a lower court s decision to revive the proposed class action lawsuit filed in federal court in california in 2011 by a group of iphone users seeking monetary damages the lawsuit said apple violated federal antitrust laws by requiring apps to be sold through the company s app store and then taking a 30 percent commission from the purchases the case may hinge on how the justices apply one of the court s past decisions to the claims against apple that 1977 precedent limited damages for anti competitive conduct to those directly overcharged rather than indirect victims who paid an overcharge passed on by others apple was backed by republican president donald trump s administration some liberal and conservative justices sharply questioned an attorney for apple and u s solicitor general noel francisco who argued on behalf of the administration on the company s side over their argument that the consumers were not directly affected by purchasing the apps from apple liberal justice elena kagan explaining how an app store purchase is handled said from my perspective i ve just engaged in a one step transaction with apple some conservative justices including trump appointee neil gorsuch wondered whether the 1977 ruling was still valid in a modern marketplace conservative chief justice john roberts questions suggested he agreed with apple s position roberts expressed concern that for a single price increase apple could be held liable by both consumers and app developers the iphone users including lead plaintiff robert pepper of chicago have argued that apple s monopoly leads to inflated prices compared to if apps were available from other sources though developers set the prices of their apps apple collects the payments from iphone users keeping the 30 percent commission on each purchase one area of dispute in the case is whether app developers recoup the cost of that commission by passing it on to consumers developers earned more than 26 billion in 2017 a 30 percent increase over 2016 according to apple apple spokeswoman rachel wolf tulley said in a statement after the arguments that the app store has fueled competition and promoted innovation in software development leading to millions of jobs in the sector we are hopeful the supreme court will recognize apple s critical role as a marketplace for apps and uphold existing legal precedent by finding in favor of apple and the millions of developers who sell their apps on our platform tulley said apple also backed by the u s chamber of commerce business group has argued that a ruling siding with the iphone users who filed the lawsuit would threaten the burgeoning field of e commerce which generates hundreds of billions of dollars annually in u s retail sales the plaintiffs as well as antitrust watchdog groups said closing courthouse doors to those who buy end products would undermine antitrust enforcement and allow monopolistic behavior to expand unchecked the plaintiffs were backed by 30 state attorneys general including from texas california and new york the plaintiffs said app developers would be unlikely to sue apple which controls the service where they make money leaving no one to challenge anti competitive conduct along with gorsuch conservative justice samuel alito raised the reluctance of app developers to sue apple in questioning the 1977 precedent justice brett kavanaugh another conservative trump appointee pushed back against francisco s contention that apple s actions are not the direct cause of higher prices for consumers because app makers set the final prices kavanaugh pointed out that consumers are harmed then too kavanaugh later suggested that the plaintiffs would have a more clear cut right to sue if apple bought the apps from the developers and sold them to consumers with its 30 percent commission apple has said it is acting only as the agent for app developers who sell the apps to consumers through the app store liberal justices sonia sotomayor and stephen breyer seemed certain that the iphone buyers claims should go forward they re claiming their injury is a suppression of a cheaper price sotomayor told apple s attorney daniel wall the company sought to have the antitrust claims dismissed arguing that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to bring the lawsuit a federal judge in oakland threw out the suit saying the consumers were not direct purchasers because the higher fees they paid were passed on to them by the developers the san francisco based 9th u s circuit court of appeals revived the case last year finding that apple was a distributor that sold iphone apps directly to consumers

is addressing that head on with a device and price that can still get people on the latest technology he said having a device you re sure is going to last a long time is exactly what consumers want the new aluminum and glass se which comes in black white and red looks much like an iphone 8 the cheaper phone enters a cut throat market for value phones especially in china where apple derives about 17 of sales in china rivals such as xiaomi corp 1810 hk last month announced models with 5g features starting at about 425 but bajarin said buyers interested in 5g may gravitate toward flagship phones while budget buyers are not people that would give a hoot about 5g with wavering hardware sales apple has been investing in subscription services such as its apple tv streaming television service apple music and icloud the new se will come bundled with a one free year of the streaming television service similar to apple s flagship devices released last fall given its price tag the iphone se is unlikely to be that impactful for apple s financials but could help widen the installed base which will be helpful long term for apple s services revenue said james cordwell an analyst with atlantic equities horace dediu an analyst with asymco said that budget minded phone buyers may not pay attention to whether a device has apple s latest chips but third party app developers do if more iphone users have powerful hardware he said it could encourage developers to create apps with augmented reality and artificial intelligence that could help the devices stand out against competitors the

to upgrade put off by chill economic winds even so domestic brands led by huawei have made big strides wooing consumers with top notch hardware and innovative features as they move upmarket in the 500 800 price range the result a loss of share in a key segment for apple inc and fresh price cuts for iphones by chinese retailers of those people who are upgrading there are many switching from apple to chinese brands but very few switching from chinese brands to apple said jiang ning who manages a xiaomi store in the northern province of shandong huawei technologies co ltd xiaomi corp oppo and vivo once sought to grab share in the world s biggest smartphone market with value for money devices but consumer demand for better phones has prompted strategic rethinks people are more attached to their phone than ever and have higher expectations for the function and experience it offers the response has been constant upgrading of hardware specs alen wu global vice president at oppo told reuters he fan ceo of huishoubao which buys and resells used phones said he has seen a consumer shift to huawei from apple driven by the chinese love of selfies and emphasis on camera quality huawei has had a tie up with german camera maker leica since 2016 huawei s cameras have become noticeably better than apple s in that they suit the tastes of chinese consumers more he said compared to dual cameras common in most smartphones huawei s p20 pro device boasts three rear facing cameras with the additional one improving zoom capabilities it is one of several new devices in its p20 and mate 20 lines which helped huawei s share of the 500 800 segment in china surge to 26 6 percent last year from 8 8 percent data from research firm counterpoint shows apple by contrast saw its share of the segment tumble to 54 6 percent from 81 2 percent also hurt by its decision to move even further upmarket with the iphone x series most chinese smartphone buyers are not ready to shell out beyond 1 000 for a

sold at suning com co ltd now costs 3 899 yuan 580 roughly 25 percent less than it did in december that s also lower than its 599 price tag in the united states where iphones typically cost less to

december revenue from the greater china region fell by about a quarter from a year earlier greater china currently accounts for 15 6 percent of its overall revenue huawei the world s no 2 smartphone maker has estimated revenue for 2018 rose 21 percent which analysts attribute in large part to robust smartphone sales more broadly fewer sales for apple means fewer customers for its app store and media streaming services the shift to higher end phones by chinese brands has also meant greater inroads in overseas markets huawei s shipments in europe jumped 55 percent in the latest quarter and it now has 23 6 percent market share according to canalys that s not far behind samsung electronics and apple which saw small declines in shipments if huawei is taking the lion s share of turf that apple

AAPL,2019-03-22,Apple's iPhone struggles unravel ambitions of Japan Display,tokyo reuters when japan display inc broke ground on a new factory in central japan in 2015 the future looked bright for one of the world s top vendors of liquid crystal display lcd panels the plant would strengthen the company s position as the primary screen supplier for apple inc as sales of the iphone 6 soared and the u s smartphone juggernaut said it would front most of the 1 5 billion in costs with japan display paying it back with a percentage of screen sales according to two company sources four years later apple s shifting fortunes have brought japan display to its knees and threaten to end japan s long run as a leader in display technology a slowdown in iphone sales combined with a proliferation of new iphone models many of which use newer organic light emitting displays oled have left japan display s new factory running at half capacity but it still owes apple a majority of the construction cost one of the company sources said he declined to give the exact amount desperate for capital japan display is looking to an investor group led by china silkroad investment capital for a bailout two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the deal would give the chinese group a near majority stake in exchange for an investment of 500 million to 700 million the sources said the group plans to build an oled panel plant in china using japan display s technology according to those two sources the company s woes show how weak iphone sales and a broader slowdown in the smartphone business are causing pain across the asian electronics supply chain in retrospect the new plant was unnecessary one of the sources with direct knowledge of the bailout talks said but the decision wasn t wrong back then japan display started to pick up steam thanks to apple at the time and apple wanted the new plant japan display wasn t alone in betting on robust growth in iphone sales which looked especially attractive because of apple s now abandoned strategy of offering few variations in each product cycle we were all thrilled to see lifetime sales of a single iphone model reaching 100 million units a source at another apple parts supplier said supplying components for just one model in massive volume is extremely cost efficient he said at the same time we exposed ourselves to huge volatility risks japan display has built relationships with other smartphone vendors including chinese powerhouses huawei xiaomi and oppo but it is losing their orders too as sales growth softens and the chinese players switch to domestic panel makers such as boe technology and tianma microelectronics which have sharply improved the quality of their screens japan display supplied almost a third of huawei s smartphone screens in 2015 but its share had plunged to 4 percent by the third quarter last year as the chinese company turned to boe and tianma according to researcher ihs markit sources at japan display and other apple suppliers interviewed for the story declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media suppliers rarely speak about business with apple on the record because of strict non disclosure agreements japan display was formed in 2012 in a government backed merger of the ailing display units of sony corp toshiba corp and hitachi ltd it boasts strength in so called thin film transistor technology tft crucial for making high resolution images on both lcd and oled panels in addition to its apple business which accounted for more than half the company s revenue over the last four years it s a top supplier of dashboard panels for major automotive component companies such as continental but japan display has struggled to navigate the fast changing display business its new lcd factory was still under construction when apple informed japan display in autumn 2015 that it planned to move quickly away from lcd to the newer oled technology two former company officials said it was too costly by then to abandon the half completed plant one of them said japan display s management at the time led by former sanyo electric executive mitsuru homma promised to start mass production of oled panels by 2018 in the meantime the management shut down older unprofitable lcd lines to shift resources to oled but its main investor a state backed fund blocked plans for drastic job cuts for fear of public backlash one of the former officials said unexpectedly weak sales of the iphone 6s created a cash crunch in 2016 and homma resigned early the next year after the company took a 640 million bailout from the state backed fund the new chief executive nobuhiro higashiiriki declared a full on shift to oled but the company was already behind rivals notably samsung electronics and still needed more cash for oled investment disappointing sales of the iphone xr the only lcd model in apple s 2018 lineup were yet another blow the company now looks exhausted with many engineers leaving one former employee said some board members have expressed concerns about technology transfer that may follow the proposed chinese investment sources familiar with the talks said but the government investment fund has run out of patience we don t have any other option one of the company sources said adding that the government has been quiet about the bailout plan they could argue that display technologies are not something japan must keep and protect when chinese panel makers are ramping up more display plants

combined with its existing portfolio apple will have 17 000 wireless technology patents ranging from cellular communication standards to modems making it a more powerful player in global licensing talks that will likely take place between major 5g patent holders such as huawei technologies co ltd intel shares rose 5 7 to 55 05 after the news and the company s report that its earnings beat analysts expectations apple shares edged up 0 1 to 207 29 after the deal intel will retain the right to develop modems for non smartphone applications such as pcs industrial equipment and self driving cars modem chips connect devices like the iphone to wireless data networks but apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part intel positioned itself as the sole source of iphone modem chips over the past year after apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier qualcomm inc over qualcomm patent licensing practices cupertino california based apple reached a surprise settlement in april that called for the iphone to once again use qualcomm modem chips within hours intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business apple s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies making the intel deal its second largest ever after its 3 2 billion purchase of beats electronics in 2014 the deal with intel will bolster apple s goal to make its own modem chip two of apple s biggest global rivals samsung electronics co ltd and huawei already have the ability to self supply modem chips technology news publication the information last year reported apple s efforts to develop its own modem but the iphone maker has never formally acknowledged it in february reuters reported that apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self designed modem chip apple chief executive tim cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate what analysts have called the cook doctrine we believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make tim cook told investors back in 2009 the purchase of intel s assets could help apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem a person familiar with the matter said apple plans to use qualcomm s modem technology for a 5g iphone in 2020 but wants to have an internally developed 5g modem technology ready for use in some of its products by 2021 intel previously disclosed plans to have a 5g modem ready by 2020 so tapping the intel assets could help apple hit its target but any replacement of qualcomm is likely to happen in phases this person said as apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where apple sells phones ensuring worldwide compatibility is qualcomm s historical strength and apple might still have to rely on qualcomm for some modems during a transition period to its own devices there s a fierce desire at apple to have independence but they also realize it has to be done responsibly this person said apple s license deal with qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters apple is likely to continue to use the san diego firm s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower end and older models this person said apple has engaged with taiwan s global unichip corp a chip design house in which apple supplier taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co is an investor to explore a modem design but the work is in early stages clearly apple saw the handwriting on the wall because they came around and did a deal with qualcomm this person said apple declined to comment on its plans and qualcomm and global unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment the most valuable aspect of the intel deal for apple could turn out to be patents to sell a 5g iphone apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5g patents including nokia ericsson huawei and qualcomm apple executed a licensing deal with qualcomm but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others erick robinson a patent attorney who had worked in qualcomm s licensing division in

AAPL,2021-03-18,Class counsel in Apple ‘throttling’ case beat multifront attack to land $81 million in fees, reuters has there ever been a fee request attacked from more vantages than a motion last summer for 87 7 million by class counsel in a 310 million settlement with apple sure objecting class members including one represented by ted frank s hamilton lincoln law institute groused about the fee request no surprise there but 12 state attorneys general led by kentucky ag daniel cameron also told u s district judge edward davila of san jose california that class counsel from cotchett pitre mccarthy and kaplan fox kilsheimer deserved no more than their lodestar billings of about 36 million the u s justice department chimed in urging the judge to remember that every dollar awarded to class counsel is a dollar that consumers will not receive even apple opposed the fee request asserting that cotchett and kaplan fox should not be paid a percentage of the class recovery because of the unusual structure of the settlement in apple s depiction class counsel could not recover a percentage of the class money because the company s payout a minimum of 310 million and a maximum of 500 million depended on how many claims class members ended up making the settlement resolved allegations that apple throttled the performance of devices with aging batteries to induce owners to buy new devices apple denied the allegations insisting that it was helping device owners manage the performance of their phone to avoid shutdowns cotchett and kaplan fox had answers for their multiplicity of critics of course they argued among other things that apple didn t have standing to object to the fees which were to be paid by class members the firms also asserted that the state ags waited too long to brief the fee issue and gave class counsel vastly too little credit for the results they obtained the plaintiffs firms said their 87 7 million fee request was just a little more than the 9th circuit s benchmark rate of 25 of the class recovery a just reward they said for the cash they delivered to class members on wednesday the judge gave cotchett and kaplan fox the best revenge davila awarded the firms 80 6 million in fees it wasn t quite the 87 7 million they had asked for the judge said he could not swallow a 2 43 multiplier on the firms lodestar billings but it was more than the typical percentage judges grant in mega fund settlements topping 100 million indeed 80 6 million works out to 26 of the 310 million that will go to the class that s a shade higher than the 9th circuit s 25 benchmark class counsel s strategic and efficient lawyering in the instant action encouraged a just and efficient determination of this litigation the judge wrote the results achieved in this case are laudable plaintiffs lawyers were happy to take the win in response to my email query mark molumphy of cotchett highlighted apple s self serving objections to plaintiffs fee request it is notable that judge davila made the point to recognize the extraordinary effort coordination and communication of plaintiffs counsel and all the hard work that ultimately resulted in this historic settlement he said the judge s discussion of apple s argument is the most interesting part of the opinion which does not even mention fee briefs by the state ags and doj as i ve explained apple s lawyers at gibson dunn crutcher asserted a novel argument that the minimum 310 million payout to class members was not a common fund the settlement was structured to provide class members with payouts of at least 25 if class claims for that 25 recovery exceeded 310 million the company said it would boost its payment by as much as 190 million to a maximum of 500 million if on the other hand the claims rate was so low that class claims for 25 did not reach 310 million each claimant would receive more money apple said that the deal was a claims made settlement and the standard procedure in claims made settlements is to base class counsel fees on lodestar billings the judge rejected apple s characterization of the agreement he also said that apple didn t have standing to object to the fee request but said it was nevertheless appropriate to analyze the company s argument class counsel he said based their fee request on a percentage of the minimum 310 million payout from apple that minimum recovery davila said was a certainty for the class and could not revert to apple by contrast none of the cases apple cited to support its argument for lodestar fees involved settlements with a guaranteed cash recovery for the class and fees to be paid from that recovery apple pointed to one case in which the defendant was to pay class counsel fees outside of the class fund and another with no established minimum payout to the class in yet a third case apple cited davila wrote the settlement provided for reimbursement of class members expenses but it wasn t clear what those reimbursements would total all of the above the judge wrote supports applying the percentage of the fund method apple counsel theodore boutrous of gibson dunn referred my email query to apple which didn t immediately respond davila approvingly cited the objectors brief from ted frank s group frank said in an email that he was glad to see the judge agree that the magnitude of the settlement in this case was due more to the size of the class than to an extraordinary outcome for class members but the fee award itself frank said is a non sequitur inconsistent with the reasoning frank said the class notice program was clearly inadequate given that apple was willing to pay nearly 200 million more than the 310 million minimum we re very disappointed that class counsel face no consequences for this suboptimal response that cost class members 190 million frank said his group he said is considering its appellate options opinions expressed here are those of the author reuters news under the

was initiated by foxconn s founder terry gou according to one of the sources to target dongguan based luxshare 002475 sz which is little known internationally but is poised to become the first mainland china headquartered firm to assemble iphones a turf until now dominated by taiwanese manufacturers the task force which the sources say was created last year has been looking into luxshare s

coronavirus crisis have intensified pressure on global supply chains an increasingly acrimonious tech feud between the economic giants has also prompted beijing to strengthen efforts on creating world leading local tech firms and luxshare s growth trajectory fits into that mould luxshare is set to rise it s just a matter of how fast it could be one of the sources said it makes sense for china to build up its own supply chain and luxshare is in line with that state policy that state policy analysts say is gaining traction with the rise of china s red supply chain where chinese firms with

once a worker at foxlink owned by gou s brother t c gou its journey up apple s value chain has been driven in part by acquiring smaller components makers starting with the manufacturing of connector
